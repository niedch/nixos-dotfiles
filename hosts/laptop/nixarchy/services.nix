# Why: modules/AGENTS.md#services-and-system-settings-as-nixos-configuratio
{...}: {
  # ── Development ──────────────────────────────────────
  programs.nixarchy.services.devenv.enable = true; #@ devenv  # Per-project development environments that activate when you cd in. Bundled because it is a package plus an activation hook in each of bash, zsh and fish, and a cache to keep the first use from being a compile.
  # programs.nixarchy.services.microvm.enable = true;  #@ microvm  # Permanent NixOS sandboxes from a template, booted with no image build and no bootloader -- the host's own /nix/store, shared read-only. Bundled because declaring a machine is what turns on the system user, the kvm group grant, the kernel modules and the microvm CLI; a machine you never declare gets none of them.
  # virtualisation.podman.enable = true;  #@ podman  # Rootless containers next to Docker, which stays the default engine -- the `docker` command keeps meaning Docker. Brings the Podman panel with it (Super+Alt+O); Boxes turns podman on as well.
  # virtualisation.waydroid.enable = true;  #@ waydroid  # Android apps in a container on your own kernel. No CPU emulation, so it is fast -- and ARM-only apps will not run without a translation layer (libhoudini/libndk) that Waydroid does not ship and nixpkgs does not package. Needs the binder kernel module, which mainline has and a custom kernel may not, and ships without the Play Store. For apps that refuse to run in a container at all, scrcpy mirrors a real phone instead.

  # ── Desktop ──────────────────────────────────────
  # services.flatpak.enable = true;  #@ flatpak  # For software nixpkgs does not carry. Then: flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
  # programs.nixarchy.services.open-webui.enable = true;  #@ open-webui  # A browser chat window over the models this machine already runs. Needs an Ollama -- programs.nixarchy.localAi.enable is the one that puts a model on the machine -- and refuses to build without one rather than showing you an empty model list. Stays on loopback: the first visitor to reach it becomes the administrator, so open the firewall only after you have logged in once.
  # programs.nixarchy.services.syncthing.enable = true;  #@ syncthing  # Syncs folders between your machines. Bundled because it runs as you, and upstream cannot know which user that is.

  # ── Hardware ──────────────────────────────────────
  # hardware.graphics.enable32Bit = true;  #@ graphics32  # Wanted by Steam, Wine and older games. One switch covers every driver.

  # ── Network ──────────────────────────────────────
  # programs.nixarchy.services.hypr-rdp.enable = true;  #@ hypr-rdp  # Serve your running Hyprland session to any RDP client. Bundled because the password must come from an encrypted secret, the daemon needs your session, and the firewall stays closed unless you say otherwise. Reachable over your tailnet by default, not your LAN.
  # services.openssh.enable = true;  #@ openssh  # Remote login. Opens port 22 and NixOS defaults to keys only, not passwords.
  # programs.nixarchy.services.tailscale.enable = true;  #@ tailscale  # A private network between your machines. Bundled because the firewall has to trust the interface or nothing reaches this host.

  # ── Flatpak ──────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # Declared, not reproducible: the ids below travel to your next
  # machine, the versions do not. A rollback restores this list, not
  # the software that was installed from it, and the first switch
  # after enabling one needs a network.
  #
  # Their data in ~/.var/app is yours and nixarchy never touches
  # it: turning one off here removes the app, not what you did
  # with it.
  # programs.nixarchy.flatpaks.apps.geforce-now.enable = true;  #@ geforce-now  # Streams games from NVIDIA's servers. Not in nixpkgs and not packageable: a proprietary binary NVIDIA ships as a Flatpak. Not on Flathub either -- it comes from NVIDIA's own repository, which enabling this adds. — from GeForceNOW, not Flathub
